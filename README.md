# QA Cinema

## How to Install QA Cinema

1. Firstly, fork the project to your own github account to create a seperate copy of the project

2. Run the below command to clone the github to your local machine

` git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/qa-cinema.git`

3. Navigate to the root directory with:
   ` cd <your_path>/qa-cinema`

4. Run `npm i` in both the back-end and front-end. If you would like a helpful command see below:

`cd Back-End/ && npm i && cd ../Front-End/ && npm i`

5. In the Front-End folder, which you should be in if you used the above command, run the command below. This will start up both the front end and back end.

`npm run startboth`

Congratulations, you should now have a working, running, version of the QA-Cinema application.

## How to Test

Testing the application is fairly simple. Assuming that you have followed the above tutorial for installing the application and that the application is currently running.

1. Firstly, stop the application using `CTRL+C`
2. Next, navigate to the back-end using `cd ../Back-End`
3. Finally, execute `npm run test`

Unfortunately, there is currently no front end testing.
