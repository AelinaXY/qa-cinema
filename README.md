# QA Cinema

## How to Install QA Cinema

1. Firstly, fork the project to your own github account to create a seperate copy of the project

2. Run the below command to clone the github to your local machine

` git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/qa-cinema.git`

3. Navigate to the root directory with:
   ` cd <your_path>/qa-cinema`

4. Run `npm i` in both the back-end and front-end. If you would like a helpful command see below:

`cd Back-End/ && npm i && cd ../Front-End/ && npm i`

5. In the Front-End folder, which you should be in if you used the above command, run the command below. This will start up both the front end and back end.

`npm run startboth`

Congratulations, you should now have a working, running, version of the QA-Cinema application.
